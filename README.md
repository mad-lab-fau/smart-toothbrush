# Overview 
The smart toothbrush is a custom microcontroller board that is built around an **ESP32 processor**. It contains an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** for tracking linear accelerations with an accelerometer and rotational velocities with a gyroscope. Additionally, a **Real-Time Clock (RTC)** unit is used for timekeeping. The data is written onto a **MircoSD card**. All these components are mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), providing a compact and efficient design. The electronics are protected from environmental influences by a customised outer case in the shape of a toothbrush. The result is a smart toothbrush with replaceable brushes that can be used for normal tooth brushing.
